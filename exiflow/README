What is ExiFlow?

A set of tools (command line and GUI) to provide a complete
digital photo workflow for Unixes. EXIF headers are used as
the central information repository, so users may change
their software at any time without loosing their data.
 


Are we defining a fixed workflow?

Not really. You may integrate these tools into your workflow
in any way you want. However, it may be good to understand
what kind of workflow we are in, and eventually adapt as
much of it as possible for two reasons:

1. The workflow we use is of course fully supported by our
   tools.

2. We killed huge amounts of time with reading and thinking
   before we started to code, so there's nothing in our
   workflow we can't explain. Read on to learn about it.



Are filenames important?

Yes, absolutely. The names that your camera generates are
neither expressive nor unique, so they are not the first
choice for long term archiving.

Some theory:

It's good to have the image number in the filename, but it
would be better to have the date and time of shooting in
there, too, as well as the artist name and the full camera
model used, and of course the revision number of edited
pictures as parts of the filename would also be handy.
Put all that together and you come up with names of
100 characters or more. Sadly, most photo professionals
recommend limiting filenames to 26 characters over all to
satisfy the needs of all photo databases, printing
services and commercial archiving software. At the same
time they recommend to include at least the date, the
artists initials and a revision number.

The solution:

Considering all this, we came up with the following
file naming scheme to include as much information as
possible in 26 bytes:

Given a camera that saves a file as:

dsc_1234.nef

we will rename that file to:

20050412-n001234-ur000.nef

At first there is 20050412. That's a date, telling us the
photo has been taken on 2005-04-12. This is determined by
looking it up in the image's EXIF information.

Then there is n001234. The "n00" part is read from a config
file as the three byte string to be put there for a given
camera model. In this case, the camera model information in
the EXIF header reads "Nikon D70", and the config section
for that model reads "n00", meaning an "n" as a model
indicator since I also own an HP camera for which I
configured "h00", and the "00" as a way to extend the
counting possibilities beyond 9999 pictures. Once the
camera switches from 9999 to 0000 I will change that string
to "n01". The "1234" part is just the numeric part of the
original filename.

At last there is ur000. "ur" are my initials; I have
simply configured "If it's a Nikon D70, the artist is me".
Of course there are possibilities to override that. The
"000" part is a revision number. This is an original,
untouched file, so it's revision is 000. An automatic
conversion to JPG would also have revision 000 since there
is no interaction and the files are still distinguishable
by their suffixes. Once I convert it with custom parameters
or do some kind of editing, I will save it as revision 100.
Another derivate of the original will get revision 200.
A derivate of revision 100 will get 110, a derivate of 110
will get 111 and another one will get 112. Got the idea?
Using this revision scheme lets you know about the basic
editing history (if there's any) by just looking at the
filename. If this is too complicated for your needs you
are free to use these three bytes in another way or to
leave them alone.

There's one exception regarding the initial "000" revision:
If the software detects the presence of a low quality JPG
accompanying a raw image, the raw file gets revision 000 as
usual, but the low quality file will get revision 00l so
that it can't be confused with an automatically converted
*000.jpg of high quality.



Which tools are provided by ExiFlow?

exigui
This is the GTK frontend for all other tools but exiimport.
If the mouse is your best friend you will like this one.

exiimport
Import files from given directories to your photo folder.
Optionally unmounts source media after successfull import.

exirename
Rename a bunch of image files according to our holy file
naming schema.

exiperson
Personalize images by setting EXIF fields to values
spezified in exif.cfg or on command line. Any arbitrary
field name may be configured or given. This is normally
used for artist and copyright information.

exiassign
Find groups of derived images and exchange EXIF information
between them. That way, a freshly edited derivate can
automatically inherit it's mothers EXIF information.

exigate
Automatically gate information between gthumb metadata and
the image's EXIF information. This let's you describe and
tag your photos whith gthumb and transfer everything to the
according EXIF tags afterwards. The other direction is also
possible, so you are never bound to using one specific
piece of software.
